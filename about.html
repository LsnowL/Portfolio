					<p class="grid-item">I am an international student from China in Simon Fraser University. As an Interactive Arts and Technology student, it is a great chance to well know different design skills for me. With plenty of practice on teamwork in school, I am well-organized in a group, and good enough to communicate with team members. Last but not the least, keeping a sense of curiosity
					and keeping working hard are secrets to keep my life progress.</p>
